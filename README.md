# RTOS for Wearable Devices Simulation

## 📌 Introduction
Wearable devices like smartwatches, fitness bands, and health monitors require an efficient **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. This project simulates an RTOS environment for wearables, demonstrating task scheduling, sensor data processing, and battery management in real-time.

## 🎯 Project Overview
This simulation mimics how an **RTOS** operates in wearable devices by performing the following:
- **Task Scheduling:** Efficient execution of multiple tasks like heart rate monitoring, step counting, and temperature measurement.
- **Real-Time Sensor Data Processing:** Displaying live data for heart rate, step count, and body temperature.
- **Battery Consumption Tracking:** Simulating power usage based on active tasks.
- **Performance Visualization:** Charts to monitor system performance.

## 📂 Features
✅ Real-time clock displaying the current time.  
✅ Start, stop, and reset controls for simulating an RTOS environment.  
✅ Dynamic task scheduling to execute sensor readings at intervals.  
✅ Visual representation of heart rate, step count, and temperature trends.  
✅ Power management simulation to track battery consumption.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for front-end development.
- **Chart.js** for real-time data visualization.
- **JavaScript Timers & Event Listeners** for task scheduling.

## 🏗️ How It Works
1. **Click 'Start'** – The simulation begins, and tasks like heart rate monitoring and step counting execute in intervals.
2. **Tasks Execute Dynamically** – The system schedules tasks in the background, mimicking an RTOS environment.
3. **Charts Update in Real-Time** – Sensor data is visualized on performance charts.
4. **Click 'Stop'** – The simulation pauses all scheduled tasks.
5. **Click 'Reset'** – The system resets, clearing all values.

## 🎓 Operating System Concepts Covered
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):** Efficient task handling and scheduling.
- **Task Scheduling:** Managing multiple processes in real-time.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Simulating event-driven execution.
- **Resource Management:** Tracking system power consumption.


## 📢 Future Enhancements
